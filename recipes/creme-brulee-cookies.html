  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Caramelized sugar is our new favorite frosting sub.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <p>
  <h4>For The Cookies</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>3/4 c. (1 1/2 sticks) butter, softened</li>
    <li>1/2 c. packed brown sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 c. granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 tbsp. pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 c. all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tsp. cornstarch</li>
    <li>1 tsp. baking soda</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp. kosher salt</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
  <h4>For the Frosting</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (8-oz.) block cream cheese, softened</li>
    <li>1 1/4 c. powdered sugar</li>
    <li>1 tsp. pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/4 c. granulated sugar</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350° and line two cookie sheets with parchment. Cream butter and sugars until light and fluffy,
      3 to 4 minutes. Mix in egg and vanilla.</li>

    <li>In another bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt, then add mixture to wet ingredients
      and mix until smooth. Dough will be thick.</li>

    <li>Using a small cookie scoop, place tablespoon balls of dough onto parchment-lined cookie sheets. Press down
      lightly on each cookie to flatten slightly. Bake until edges are just starting to brown, 9 to 10 minutes.</li>

    <li>Remove from oven and let cool 2 to 3 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.</li>

    <li>Make frosting: Beat cream cheese until smooth. Add powdered sugar and vanilla and mix until smooth.</li>

    <li>Put sugar into a small bowl. Spread about a tablespoon of frosting onto tops of each cookie, then press into
      granulated sugar, coating frosting with sugar.</li>

    <li>Just before serving, use a kitchen torch to caramelize sugar on top, then set aside to cool. Store cookies in
      the fridge for up to 4 days.</li>
  </ol>
