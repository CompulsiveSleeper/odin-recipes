  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Make homemade cinnamon rolls in 90 minutes with a soft, quick-rising dough.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>¾ cup milk</li>
    <li>¼ cup margarine, softened</li>
    <li>3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 (.25 ounce) package instant yeast</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ cup water</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
    <li>½ cup margarine, softened</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>½ cup raisins (Optional)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat milk in a small saucepan until just hot to touch or a few bubbles form
      around the edge. Remove from heat and stir in margarine until melted; set
      aside.</li>

    <li>Combine 2 1/4 cups flour, white sugar, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Add
      milk mixture, water, and egg; beat well. Add remaining 1 cup flour, 1/2 cup
      at a time, stirring well after each addition.</li>

    <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about
      5 minutes. Cover with a damp cloth and let rest for 10 minutes.</li>

    <li>While dough is resting, mix together brown sugar, margarine, and cinnamon in
      a small bowl. Set aside.</li>

    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin
      pan.</li>

    <li>Roll dough out on a lightly floured surface into a 12x9-inch rectangle.
      Spread brown sugar mixture over dough; sprinkle with raisins. Roll up dough
      and pinch seam to seal. Cut into 12 equal rolls and place cut-side up in the
      prepared muffin cups. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.</li>

    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 20 minutes. Remove rolls
      from muffin cups to cool on a wire rack. Serve warm.</li>
  </ol>
